# Grocery-Store
This is my first project integrating Servlets and JDBC, building a dynamic grocery store. Users can register, browse products, add to cart, and place orders. The app features user authentication, cart management, order processing, and an admin panel with MySQL for data storage. This project strengthened my Java web development skills!
