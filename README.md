# ðŸ›’ Grocery-Store Web Application
This project is my first hands-on experience integrating Servlets and JDBC, where I built a dynamic and interactive Grocery Store Web Application. The application enables users to browse, add, and purchase grocery items while maintaining seamless backend interactions with a MySQL database.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Backend: Java Servlets, JDBC
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: MySQL
Development Tools: Eclipse, Apache Tomcat
ðŸŒŸ Features
âœ… User Authentication: Register and log in securely to access personalized features.
âœ… Product Management: View, add, update, and delete grocery items.
âœ… Cart Functionality: Add items to the cart and proceed to checkout.
âœ… Database Connectivity: Uses JDBC to fetch, store, and update data in MySQL.
âœ… Order Processing: Place and track orders seamlessly.
âœ… Admin Panel: Manage inventory and user orders efficiently.

ðŸ“Œ Learning Outcomes
ðŸ”¹ Gained hands-on experience with Java Servlets and JDBC for backend development.
ðŸ”¹ Implemented database CRUD operations and optimized SQL queries.
ðŸ”¹ Understood the request-response cycle in Java web applications.
ðŸ”¹ Worked with session management for user authentication.

This project marks my journey into full-stack Java web development and lays a strong foundation for advanced Spring Boot and Hibernate integration in future projects.
